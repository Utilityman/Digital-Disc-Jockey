### Listen to music anywhere you can plug in.

Idea: If you can provide power to a device with DDJ and that device also has audio output, 
you will be able to run DDJ in some way or another. 
Users will feed their music to DDJ and be able to plug in to computers or speakers and listen to their
library with the portability of Java. 


I would like to create it so that users will have a variety of options of how to run this - whether it be on a 
machine (MAC, Linux, PC) or via mobile (Android), over the net (server based). 

Should be a fun relevant project to design.
